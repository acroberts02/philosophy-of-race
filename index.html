        <p>In a world increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence and related technologies, it is crucial, now more than ever, that we break down and look closely at the way these technologies are handling inherently human biases. From security features to hiring policies, we are putting defining responsibilities in the hands of technologies that have not been researched or safeguarded nearly enough.</p>

        <p>In his article <em>A philosophical analysis of AI and Racism</em>, Lel Jones shares some scary statistics regarding the implications of AI involvement in these technologies. He presents how Google's facial recognition software recognized people of color as gorillas due to the lack of representation in their original dataset and how AI is replacing jobs in fields with disproportionately high levels of employment of people of color. These are obviously severe issues with detrimental consequences but are the algorithms themselves racist? And if so, what can be done?</p>

        <p>Continue exploring this webpage to learn more about how AI works and the implications it is having on real people. I will argue that AI and similar algorithms can be considered racist based on Joshua Glasgow's view of racism as disrespect towards racialized groups. I will explore this argument through case studies, objections, and implications which can be navigated to by scrolling or through clicking each section on the navigation bar.</p>

          <!-- Replace these paragraphs with your own explanation -->
          <p>In this project I will use Joshua Glasgow’s theory of racism as disrespect to support my argument that AI and related algorithms can be racist. Glasgow understands racism as anything, an action, word, policy, sign, and so on, that disrespects a member of a racialized group on the basis of their membership in that group. In this context, he defines disrespect in moral terms. He says that disrespect is a failure to recognize an individual or group as an autonomous, deserving, morally significant being. On this view, racism is treating that individual or group as less deserving because of their race. Importantly, Glasgow applies this idea to both individual people and larger systems alike.</p>
          <p>This definition is not tied to a particular ‘location’, such as the heart or beliefs, as some of his philosophical counterparts’ views are. That gives it the flexibility necessary to analyze the complex question of AI. According to Glasgow’s definition, there need not be conscious intention or ill will for there to be racism. The focus is widened from explicit hateful actions and slurs to include any case in which someone or something disrespects people on the grounds of race.</p>

          <!-- Replace these paragraphs with your second context explanation -->
          <p>It's hard to determine whether AI can be racist without knowing how it works, and let's be honest, figuring out how your sheet of metal is talking to you like a human is not exactly intuitive. So let’s cover some of the basics of AI and machine learning before we try to nail down the argument.</p>
          <p>There are many kinds of AI, but a lot of modern systems, including language models, follow a similar basic idea. You can think of AI as a big mathematical system that is solving for the best possible answer. Each word, phrase, sentence, or whatever chunk the algorithm works with is represented as numbers. When you ask an AI a question, it uses the big mathematical equation to give different possible output scores based on how likely or appropriate they are contextually. In the end it selects the chunk with the highest score to respond with. Think of semantically similar words, for example if I say the word "dog" in my query, the word “pet" is more likely to appear in an appropriate response than the word “pineapple.”</p>
          <p>While using this system to determine its outputs, the algorithm is also shaped by the data it was trained on. This means that when an AI is first built it won’t work at all until it has processed a large batch of training data provided by its developers. Large AI models like ChatGPT, are built on massive training sets scraped from all corners of the internet, from Reddit to Wikipedia. So what AI says and does is, at its core, a reflection of purely human content. This is why we are able to build models for specialty purposes, like diagnosing diseases or telling jokes, by only providing the model with training data pertaining to those subjects.</p>
          <p>With this better understanding, it is easier to see how these models can learn and reproduce human biases, including racist ones.</p>
